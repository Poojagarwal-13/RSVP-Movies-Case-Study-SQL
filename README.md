# RSVP-Movies-Case-Study-SQL
Deriving insights using SQL from the given data about movies published in 2017, 2018 and 2019; and giving recommendations to RSVP movies for their next project.

This case study was done as a part of Advanced Certificate Programme in Data Science from IIIT Bangalore (and upGrad) 

Problem Introduction: 

RSVP Movies is an Indian film production company which has produced many super-hit movies. They have usually released movies for the Indian audience but for their next project, they are planning to release a movie for the global audience in 2022. 
The production company wants to plan their every move analytically based on data and have approached you for help with this new project. You have been provided with the data of the movies that have been released in the past three years. You have to analyse the data set and draw meaningful insights that can help them start their new project. 
You are a data analyst and an SQL expert. You have to use SQL to analyse the given data and give recommendations to RSVP Movies based on the insights.
For your convenience, the entire analytics process has been divided into four segments, where each segment leads to significant insights from different combinations of tables. The questions in each segment with business objectives are written in the script given. You have to write the solution code below every question and submit the same SQL script file with the solution. There are some checkpoints given as ‘EXPECTED ANSWER’ in the question SQL script provided. Keep your eye out for them as they're useful pieces of information you can use to check if the result you have obtained after performing a particular task is correct or not.
Also, write the executive summary consisting of the important insights derived from the data and some recommendations to be given to RSVP movies for their project.
 
About Data:
The SQL script to load the dataset is provided by the institute.

Note:
1.	In the solution script, insights found using the code have been shared as ‘MY NOTES’.
2.	There are codes written below ‘OUT OF MY CURIOSITY’. These codes are not related to or are not a part of the solution for the question asked. These are insights that I wish to find just out of curiosity.
